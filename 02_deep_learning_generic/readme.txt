This is a object orientated implementation of deep neural learning where the user can spesific various hidden layers in the net. The idea is to implement
some generic form and test get deeper into understanding the core functionality and structure of neural net.

To test, run run_rest. One can modify the script to learn both binary data sets and a slightly more complicated non-linear function mapping.
